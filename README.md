# Stm32_Bootloader
This repository provides a bootloader implementation for the STM32F041CC microcontroller, written in C. It includes a simple desktop GUI written in Python that can parse the hex file and send it through the laptop serial port using UART communication with the STM microcontroller. The implementation is designed to be user-friendly and easy to use, making it an ideal solution for firmware updates and other applications that require bootloader functionality. With this repository, you can quickly and easily add bootloader support to your STM32F041CC-based projects.
